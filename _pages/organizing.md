Below is a list of activities I am organizing and a part of!

**Fall 2024**: I started my role as the Learning Assistant Coordinator for the Math Department. We also began having weekly Combinatorics lunches this quarter!

**Summer 2024**: I am co-organizing the [21st International Fibonacci Conference](https://21stinternationalfibonacciconference.wordpress.com/), which will be held July 8 - 12 at Harvey Mudd College, in Claremont, CA.

**Spring 2024**: I am co-organizing the UCLA Combinatorics Learning Seminar (the topic is Coxeter Groups and Root Systems, see the Writing tab for a syllabus and some notes). Additionally, along with [Olha Shevchenko](https://sites.google.com/g.ucla.edu/shevchenko), I am co-organizing the UCLA Combinatorics Research Seminar.

**Winter 2024**: I am organizing the UCLA Combinatorics Research Seminar this quarter.

**Summer 2020 and 2022**: I am co-organizing the 19th and 20th International Fibonacci Conference. The first of which, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, was held virtually, and the second of which, was held July 20 - 25 at the University of Sarajevo, in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina.
